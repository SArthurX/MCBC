# Specify the relative paths to resource pack contents.
# Each line starts with a prefix indicating the action:
#   R: Rename   (e.g., R:assets/minecraft/textures/item,assets/minecraft/item)
#   M: Modify   (e.g., M:assets/minecraft/textures/item)
#   D: Delete   (e.g., D:assets/minecraft/textures/item)
#   A: Add      (e.g., A:assets/minecraft/textures/item)
#
# All paths must be *relative* to the root of the resource pack.
# Do NOT provide full system paths like this:
#   home/user/projects/my_resource_pack/assets/minecraft/textures/item
# Instead, start from inside the resource pack, like:
#   /assets/minecraft/textures/item
